## 4. 🗂️ Event Storage

The system stores detected changes and AI-processed results in a structured event table. It supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL backends.

| Field         | Type        | Description                          |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`          | UUID / PK   | Unique event identifier              |
| `monitor_id`  | UUID / FK   | Associated monitor reference         |
| `url`         | TEXT        | Source URL of the event              |
| `title`       | TEXT        | Event title or content heading       |
| `published_at`| TIMESTAMP   | Publication or detection timestamp   |
| `summary_quick` | TEXT     | Fast extracted summary               |
| `gpt_summary` | TEXT        | AI-generated interpretation          |
| `tags`        | TEXT[]      | Optional tags assigned               |
| `score`       | INTEGER     | Assigned importance or priority      |
| `geo`         | JSONB       | Optional geolocation metadata        |
| `status`      | TEXT        | Event processing state (`new`, `done`, etc.) |
| `alert`       | BOOLEAN     | Whether notification is needed       |
| `flags`       | TEXT[]      | Error or processing flags            |
| `screenshot`  | TEXT        | Path or URL to stored snapshot       |

- DB backend can be switched via `DB_ENGINE` environment variable

## 5. 🧠 AI Summarization

Rostral supports multi-model AI summarization for interpreting content changes and generating human-readable reports.

### Supported Models

- **OpenAI GPT-4** (via API)
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**
- **Local LLMs** (e.g. GPT4All, GGUF via llama.cpp or Ollama)

### Features

- Customizable prompts per monitor  
- Support for few-shot prompting and template variables  
- Fallback mechanism: if AI fails or times out, use `summary_quick`  
- Prompt reuse across templates via community catalog

### Testing & Reliability

- **Unit tests** for summarization field structure and content validity  
- **Integration tests** on real-world HTML, RSS and PDF examples  
- Configurable **retry and timeout** behavior per monitor  
- Planned support for async summarization queue with Celery

### Extensibility

- Shared prompt registry: `prompts/*.txt`  
- Configurable in YAML per monitor  
- Accepts PRs with new prompt types and model backends

## 6. 🔔 Alerts and Prioritization

Rostral allows defining rule-based alerts directly within each YAML monitor configuration. These alerts help prioritize important changes and notify users when specific patterns are detected.

### YAML Example

```yaml
alerts:
  - match: ["keyword1", "urgent topic"]
    score: 7
    alert: true
    notify: 
      - telegram://your-bot-token@your-channel
      - email://you@example.com
```

### Fields

- match: list of strings to match against extracted content (title, summary, etc.)
- score: integer from 1–10 indicating the event’s priority level
- alert: if true, the event will be marked for notification
- notify: list of Apprise-compatible endpoints for alert delivery

### Behavior

- Events with alert: true are eligible for notification routing  
- The score field influences sorting, filtering, and visual weight in the dashboard  
- Alert matching is case-insensitive and keyword-based (no regex in MVP)

### Notification System

Rostral integrates with the Apprise notification framework, supporting:

- Telegram  
- Email (SMTP)  
- Discord  
- Webhooks  
- ntfy, Gotify, Pushover, and others

Notifications use Jinja2 templates, allowing monitor-specific or global message layouts.

### Future Enhancements

- Adaptive alert scoring (AI-based prioritization)  
- Alert deduplication and grouping  
- Interactive rule testing via UI or CLI  
- Rule sets defined centrally and reusable across monitors

## 7. 📁 Full-Text Document Storage

Some monitors—particularly for legal filings, public tenders, and government bulletins—fetch long-form documents. Rostral supports the storage and retrieval of full-text content for deep inspection and future semantic use.

### Storage Strategy

- **Raw text is extracted** during normalization and stored in compressed format
- Supports:
  - **BLOB storage** in the database (e.g. for SQLite use cases)
  - **File-based storage** with hashed paths or monitor-scoped directories
- Compression via **gzip** to optimize disk space and transmission

### Document Metadata

- Linked to events via `event_id`
- File structure includes:
  - `.txt.gz` or `.json.gz` source files  
  - Optional raw HTML archive (`.html`)  
  - `document_id`, `created_at`, `source_type`

### Web UI Support

- Document preview in UI:
  - “Show full text” collapsible section
  - Pagination or expandable field
  - Optional keyword-highlighting

### Future Extensions

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** features, e.g. answer questions from past documents  
- **Semantic vector search** over full-text corpora  
- **Document deduplication** and clustering
