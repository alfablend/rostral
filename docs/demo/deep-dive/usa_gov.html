Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 142 / Monday, July 28, 2025 / Presidential Documents 
Executive Order 14319 of July 23, 2025 
Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in 
how Americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and 
navigate their daily lives. Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, 
but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, 
they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. 
One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called 
‚Äò‚Äòdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äô‚Äô (DEI). In the AI context, DEI includes 
the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipu-
lation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation 
of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, 
intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of 
race or sex. DEI displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred 
outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to 
reliable AI. 
For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical 
figures‚Äîincluding the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings‚Äîwhen 
prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements 
at the cost of accuracy. Another AI model refused to produce images cele-
brating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the 
same request for people of other races. In yet another case, an AI model 
asserted that a user should not ‚Äò‚Äòmisgender‚Äô‚Äô another person even if necessary 
to stop a nuclear apocalypse. 
While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality 
of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of Federal procure-
ment, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness 
and accuracy to ideological agendas. Building on Executive Order 13960 
of December 3, 2020 (Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence 
in the Federal Government), this order helps fulfill that obligation in the 
context of large language models. 
Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order: 
(a) The term ‚Äò‚Äòagency‚Äô‚Äô means an executive department, a military depart-
ment, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 
101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government cor-
poration within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101. 
(b) The term ‚Äò‚Äòagency head‚Äô‚Äô means the highest-ranking 
official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chair-
man, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors. 
(c) The term ‚Äò‚ÄòLLM‚Äô‚Äô means a large language model, which is a generative 
AI model trained on vast, diverse datasets that enable the model to generate 
natural-language responses to user prompts. 
(d) The term ‚Äò‚Äònational security system‚Äô‚Äô has the same meaning as in 
44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6). 
Sec. 3. Unbiased AI Principles. It is the policy of the United States to 
promote the innovation and use of trustworthy AI. To advance that policy, 
agency heads shall, consistent with applicable law and in consideration

Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 142 / Monday, July 28, 2025 / Presidential Documents 
of guidance issued pursuant to section 4 of this order, procure only those 
LLMs developed in accordance with the following two principles (Unbiased 
AI Principles): 
(a) Truth-seeking. LLMs shall be truthful in responding to user prompts 
seeking factual information or analysis. LLMs shall prioritize historical accu-
racy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall acknowledge uncertainty 
where reliable information is incomplete or contradictory. 
(b) Ideological Neutrality. LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools that 
do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI. 
Developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments 
into an LLM‚Äôs outputs unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise 
readily accessible to the end user. 
Sec. 4. Implementation. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation 
with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Administrator 
of General Services, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, shall issue guidance to agencies to implement section 3 of this 
order. That guidance shall: 
(i) account for technical limitations in complying with this order; 
(ii) permit vendors to comply with the requirement in the second Unbiased 
AI Principle to be transparent about ideological judgments through disclo-
sure of the LLM‚Äôs system prompt, specifications, evaluations, or other 
relevant documentation, and avoid requiring disclosure of specific model 
weights or other sensitive technical data where practicable; 
(iii) avoid over-prescription and afford latitude for vendors to comply 
with the Unbiased AI Principles and take different approaches to innova-
tion; 
(iv) specify factors for agency heads to consider in determining whether 
to apply the Unbiased AI Principles to LLMs developed by the agencies 
and to AI models other than LLMs; and 
(v) make exceptions as appropriate for the use of LLMs in national security 
systems. 
(b) Each agency head shall, to the maximum extent consistent with applica-
ble law: 
(i) include in each Federal contract for an LLM entered into following 
the date of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section 
terms requiring that the procured LLM comply with the Unbiased AI 
Principles and providing that decommissioning costs shall be charged 
to the vendor in the event of termination by the agency for the vendor‚Äôs 
noncompliance with the contract following a reasonable period to cure; 
(ii) to the extent practicable and consistent with contract terms, revise 
existing contracts for LLMs to include the terms specified in subsection 
(b)(i) of this section; and 
(iii) within 90 days of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) 
of this section, adopt procedures to ensure that LLMs procured by the 
agency comply with the Unbiased AI Principles. 
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations. 
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.

          <div>Purpose: Ensure reliable and unbiased AI outputs for Americans by preventing ideological bias, particularly from DEI-related content. Key provisions: - Banning biased AI systems promoting DEI narratives or other ideologies. - Requiring agencies to review and audit their AI models regularly. - Prohibiting manipulation of data to fit DEI agendas. - Ensuring transparency in how AI makes decisions. - Mandating the use of third-party auditors for compliance. Agencies involved: - General Services Administration (GSA) ‚Äì responsible for publication costs. - The White House ‚Äì as the issuing authority. Revokes/amends: No specific revocation or amendment is mentioned, but this order introduces a new policy restricting DEI-aligned AI systems in federal use. Policy impact: Neutral analysis This policy aims to ensure that AI used by the government provides accurate and unbiased information. It could lead to more transparency and accountability in how agencies utilize AI technologies.</div>

Title 3‚Äî 
The President 
Executive Order 14321 of July 24, 2025 
Ending Crime and Disorder on America‚Äôs Streets 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose and Policy. Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sud-
den confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe. The 
number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single 
night during the last year of the previous administration‚Äî274,224‚Äîwas 
the highest ever recorded. The overwhelming majority of these individuals 
are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both. Nearly 
two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs 
like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes. An equally 
large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health 
conditions. The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions 
of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root 
causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats. 
Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane 
treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public 
order. Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither 
compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will 
take a new approach focused on protecting public safety. 
Sec. 2. Restoring Civil Commitment. (a) The Attorney General, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate 
action to: 
(i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial 
precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United 
States‚Äô policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental 
illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the 
streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appro-
priate periods of time; and 
(ii) provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical 
guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, 
adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, 
institutional treatment, and ‚Äò‚Äòstep-down‚Äô‚Äô treatment standards that allow 
for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental 
illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and 
cannot care for themselves. 
Sec. 3. Fighting Vagrancy on America‚Äôs Streets. (a) The Attorney General, 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, and the Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate 
steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether 
priority for those grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities 
that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted 
by law: 
(i) enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; 
(ii) enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; 
(iii) enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; 
(iv) enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals 
who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental 
illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and

Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 143 / Tuesday, July 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 
cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by 
moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via 
civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent per-
mitted by law; or 
(v) substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the 
registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and 
Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with 
no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the 
location of homeless sex offenders. 
(b) The Attorney General shall: 
(i) ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes are evalu-
ated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they are sexu-
ally dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment; 
(ii) take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under 
the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to support, 
as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 et seq., encampment removal efforts 
in areas for which public safety is at risk and State and local resources 
are inadequate; 
(iii) assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be directed 
toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with 
serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack 
of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal jails or 
hospitals; and 
(iv) enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers 
that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive funding 
from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release plans and, 
to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply. 
Sec. 4. Redirecting Federal Resources Toward Effective Methods of Addressing 
Homelessness. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take 
appropriate action to: 
(i) ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder preven-
tion, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not 
fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called 
‚Äò‚Äòharm reduction‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòsafe consumption‚Äô‚Äô efforts that only facilitate illegal 
drug use and its attendant harm; 
(ii) provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs 
for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after 
the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off 
of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support 
networks; and 
(iii) ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health Centers and 
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather than promote 
homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, 
comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and 
substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. 
(b) The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to support 
the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for 
which such diversion serves public safety. 
Sec. 5. Increasing Accountability and Safety in America‚Äôs Homelessness 
Programs. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary 
of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate actions to increase 
accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness 
assistance and transitional living programs. These actions shall include, 
to the extent permitted by law, ending support for ‚Äò‚Äòhousing first‚Äô‚Äô policies 
that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and 
self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees through broadening 
the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher standards of effectiveness 
in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety.

Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 143 / Tuesday, July 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 
(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as appropriate, 
take steps to require recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assist-
ance to increase requirements that persons participating in the recipients‚Äô 
programs who suffer from substance use disorder or serious mental illness 
use substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition 
of participation. 
(c) With respect to recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assist-
ance that operate drug injection sites or ‚Äò‚Äòsafe consumption sites,‚Äô‚Äô knowingly 
distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or distribution of illicit 
drugs on property under their control: 
(i) the Attorney General shall review whether such recipients are in viola-
tion of Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 856, and bring civil or criminal 
actions in appropriate cases; and 
(ii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in coordination 
with the Attorney General, shall review whether such recipients are in 
violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive 
Federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance 
as appropriate. 
(d) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate 
measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where permissible 
under applicable law, federally funded programs to exclusively house women 
and children and to stop sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance 
through such programs from being housed with unrelated children. 
(e) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation 
with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law: 
(i) allow or require the recipients of Federal funding for homelessness 
assistance to collect health-related information that the Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development identifies as necessary to the effective and 
efficient operation of the funding program from all persons to whom 
such assistance is provided; and 
(ii) require those funding recipients to share such data with law enforce-
ment authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the collected 
health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals with mental 
health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health resources. 
Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations. 
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.

          <div>Purpose: The Executive Order aims to address crime and disorder on American streets by focusing on reducing homelessness and related issues through federal initiatives. Key Provisions: 1. **Homelessness Reduction**: Targets individuals experiencing homelessness due to drug addiction, mental health conditions, or other factors contributing to their situation. 2. **Public Safety Focus**: Aims to enhance public safety by addressing disorderly behavior and sudden confrontations linked to homelessness. 3. **Coordinated Federal Response**: Involves federal agencies in providing resources and services to support homeless individuals while ensuring legal compliance and funding availability. 4. **Legal Exclusions**: Clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights against the U.S., its departments, or entities. 5. **Publication Costs**: Assigns responsibility for publication costs to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Agencies Involved: - Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - Other federal agencies supporting homelessness prevention and public safety initiatives. Revokes/Amends: None explicitly mentioned in the text. Policy Impact: The order likely leads to increased focus on addressing systemic issues contributing to homelessness, potentially improving public safety but requiring allocation of resources that may vary based on implementation strategies.</div>
