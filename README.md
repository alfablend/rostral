Presidential Documents
35389 
Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 142 / Monday, July 28, 2025 / Presidential Documents 
Executive Order 14319 of July 23, 2025 
Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in 
how Americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and 
navigate their daily lives. Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, 
but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, 
they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. 
<...>

```

Output GPT summary:

*Purpose: Ensure reliable and unbiased AI outputs for Americans by preventing ideological bias, particularly from DEI-related content. Key provisions: - Banning biased AI systems promoting DEI narratives or other ideologies. - Requiring agencies to review and audit their AI models regularly. - Prohibiting manipulation of data to fit DEI agendas. - Ensuring transparency in how AI makes decisions. - Mandating the use of third-party auditors for compliance.*


**Key UI Components**:
1. **Event Feed** - Chronological updates with AI summaries
2. **Source Controls** - Template selection and execution
